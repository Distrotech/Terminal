{"name":"Terminal","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.xfce.org/apps/xfce4-terminal","body":"What is it?\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis is the Terminal emulator application. Terminal is a lightweight and\r\neasy to use terminal emulator for the X windowing system, with some new\r\nideas and features that makes it unique among X terminal emulators.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance issues\r\n==================\r\n\r\nTerminal is based on the Vte terminal widget library, just like gnome-terminal.\r\nVte is probably not the fastest terminal emulation library on earth, but its\r\none of the best when it comes to Unicode support, and not to forget, its\r\nactively developed. That said, performance is still an important issue for\r\na terminal emulator and Vte with font-antialiasing enabled can be very slow\r\neven on decent systems. Terminal therefore offers the possibility to explicitly\r\ndisable anti-aliasing for the terminal font. If you are experiencing problems\r\nwith the terminal rendering speed, you might want to disable the anti-aliasing\r\nfor the terminal font.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to report bugs?\r\n===================\r\n\r\nBugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system\r\n(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product Terminal). You will\r\nneed to create an account for yourself.\r\n\r\nPlease read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes\r\nor bugfixes for this package.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
